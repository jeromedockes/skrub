Using the Recipe
================

Skrub provides the Recipe, a convenient and interactive way to create simple or
complex machine-learning models for tabular data.

The Recipe is a helper to build a scikit-learn ``Pipeline`` and its grid of
hyperparameters.

It brings 3 major benefits:

- The pipeline can be built step by step, while easily checking the output of
  transformations we have added so far. This makes development faster and more
  interactive.

- When we add a transformation, we can easily specify on which columns it
  should be applied. Tabular data is heterogeneous and many processing steps
  only apply to some of our dataframe's columns.

- When we add a transformer or a final predictor, we can specify a range for
  any of its parameters, rather than a single value. Thus the ranges of
  hyperparameters to consider for tuning are provided directly inside the
  corresponding estimator, instead of being kept in a separate dictionary as is
  usually done with scikit-learn. Moreover, these hyperparameters can be given
  human-readable names which are useful for inspecting hyperparameter search
  results.

The Recipe is not an estimator
------------------------------

The recipe is a tool for configuring a scikit-learn estimator, it is not an
estimator itself (it does not have `fit` or `predict`) methods. Once we are
happy with our Recipe, we must call one of its methods such as
``get_pipeline``, ``get_grid_search``, â€¦, to obtain the corresponding
scikit-learn estimator.

# %%
# Getting a preview of the transformed data
# -----------------------------------------
#
# The ``Recipe`` can be initialized with the full dataset (including the
# target, ``y``) and we can tell it which columns are the target and should be
# kept separate from the rest.

# %%
from skrub import Recipe, datasets

dataset = datasets.fetch_employee_salaries()
df = dataset.X
df["salary"] = dataset.y

# %%
# At any point, we can use ``sample()`` to get a sample of the data transformed
# by the steps we have added to the recipe so far. The ``Recipe`` draws a
# random sample from the dataframe we used to initialize it, and applies the
# transformations we have specified.
#
# At this point we have not added any transformations yet, so we just get a
# sample from the original dataframe.

# %%
recipe = Recipe(df, y_cols="salary", n_jobs=8)
recipe.sample()

# %%
# If instead of a random sample we want to see the transformation of the first
# few rows in their original order, we can use ``head()`` instead of ``sample()``.
#
# We can ask for a ``TableReport`` of the transformed sample, to inspect it
# more easily:

# %%
recipe.get_report()

# %%
# Adding transformations to specific columns
# ------------------------------------------
#
# We can use the report above to explore the dataset and plan the
# transformations we need to apply to the different columns.
# In the "Column summaries" tab,
